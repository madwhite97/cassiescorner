Project 1 - Cassie's Corner Nail Salon
Madison White

A website for a nail technician's services. This website should allow the user to look at the different services and contact the client to book.

I used HTML and CSS.

In the future I want to work on spacing items out on my page better. I would also like to add a photo carousel as part of her portfolio instead of just linking her Instagram. I worked on it but couldn't get it sized right. I would like to keep improving on this site's layout and just overall design. I would also like to learn how to let somebody actually book with her on this site instead of just my broken links.
